                    <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills
                        and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had
                        only on paper and stored on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that
                        makes more sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a
                        daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that the result was just
                        something nice and did not solve any problem.</p>

                            <p>As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look
                                perfect.
                                You will learn to accept feedback and learn from it.</p>
